              Cloud computing services are generally categorized into three
              primary models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a
              Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
            </li>
            <li>
              Each model serves different business needs and offers various
              levels of control and flexibility.
            </li>
          </ul>

              Web-based platform that provides hosting for software development

              <h3 class="is-size-5">Features</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Version Control:</b> GitHub uses Git, a distributed version
                  control system, to track changes in code, allowing multiple
                  developers to collaborate on a project. It keeps a history of
                  changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if
                  needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Repositories:</b> Projects are stored in repositories,
                  which can be public (accessible to anyone) or private
                  (restricted access). Each repository contains the project
                  files and the revision history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Branches:</b> Developers can create branches in a
                  repository to work on different features or fixes
                  independently from the main codebase. Once the work is
                  complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Pull Requests:</b> When developers want to merge their
                  changes from a branch into another branch (typically the main
                  branch), they create a pull request. This allows team members
                  to review the code, discuss potential issues, and ensure
                  quality before integration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Issues and Project Management:</b> GitHub includes tools
                  for issue tracking and project management, allowing developers
                  to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests directly within
                  the platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Collaborative Features:</b> GitHub supports collaboration
                  through code reviews, comments, and discussions. Developers
                  can review each other’s code, suggest changes, and discuss
                  implementation details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Actions and Automation:</b> GitHub Actions allow developers
                  to automate workflows directly within their repositories. This
                  can include continuous integration/continuous deployment
                  (CI/CD) pipelines, automated testing, and other repetitive
                  tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Community and Social Coding:</b> GitHub also serves as a
                  social platform for developers to discover, share, and
                  contribute to open-source projects. It enables networking,
                  learning, and collaboration within the developer community.
