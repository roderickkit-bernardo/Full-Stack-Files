                  An open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for
                  building user interfaces, particularly for
                  <b>single-page applications</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's often used for building interactive and dynamic user
                  interfaces for <b>web</b> and <b>mobile applications</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  React is known for its <b>component-based architecture</b>,
                  where the user interface is broken down into reusable
                  components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each component manages its own state and can be composed
                  together to create complex UIs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This approach makes it easier to maintain and scale large
                  applications since developers can focus on building and
                  managing smaller, self-contained components.

              <h2 class="is-size-4">Key features of React</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h3 class="is-size-5">Virtual DOM:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the user
                      interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, React creates a
                      virtual representation of it in memory and updates only
                      the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, minimizing
                      browser reflows and improving performance.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3 class="is-size-5">JSX:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write
                      HTML-like code within JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This makes it easier to create React components by
                      blending HTML markup with JavaScript logic.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 class="is-size-5">Component-based architecture:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      React encourages a modular approach to building user
                      interfaces, where UIs are broken down into reusable
                      components.
                    </li>
                    <li>This promotes code reusability and maintainability.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3 class="is-size-5">Unidirectional data flow:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      React follows a unidirectional data flow model where data
                      flows in a single direction, from parent to child
                      components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This helps in maintaining predictable state changes and
                      simplifies debugging.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3 class="is-size-5">React Hooks:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and
                      other React features without writing classes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They provide a more functional approach to managing
                      component state and side-effects.

                      full control over the build setup and dependencies of your
                      React project but removes the convenience of updating
                      these configurations through Create React App's

                  ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought
                  significant improvements to JavaScript, which have had a

                      The .map() method is a powerful array method in JavaScript
                      that is commonly used in React to transform arrays of data
                      into arrays of React elements.

                      The spread operator (...) is a powerful feature in
                      JavaScript, introduced in ES6, that allows for the

                      Function components are simpler and more concise than

                      Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, allow you to use state
                      and other React features in function components. Hooks
                      like useState, useEffect, useContext, and others provide
                      powerful capabilities that were previously only available
                      in class components.

                    <li>
                      Function components can have a smaller memory footprint
                      compared to class components because they don’t require an
                      instance of a component to be created.

                    <li>
                      Function components don’t use the this keyword, which
                      avoids common pitfalls related to its usage and binding.
                      This makes the code easier to understand and debug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Function components are easier to test because they are
                      plain JavaScript functions. They don’t require complex
                      setup and teardown that might be needed for class
                      components.

                      Hooks promote better composition and reuse of stateful

                      into reusable functions.

                      Prop drilling is a common issue in React applications
                      where data is passed from a parent component to a deeply

                      that do not need the data themselves.

                    <li>
                      This can lead to components becoming cluttered with props
                      that are only passed down to children, making the code

              <ul>

                  The logical && operator can be used to conditionally include
                  an element or component. If the condition is true, the element
                  after && will be rendered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ternary operator can be used to conditionally render one
                  of two elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An if statement and checking the value of a variables can be

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The map() method allows you to iterate over an array and
                  return a new array of React elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop to help
                  React identify which items have changed, added, or removed.
                  This improves performance by aiding React in efficient DOM
                  updates.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  In React, form elements like

                  <code class="has-text-weight-bold">textarea</code>, and
                  <code class="has-text-weight-bold">select</code> typically
                  maintain their own state based on user input. However, you can
                  also control the state of these form elements by making them
                  controlled components. Controlled components allow React to
                  have full control over the form elements' state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reack hook useRef can be used to get a reference to a DOM
                  element, which can be useful for managing focus, text
                  selection, or triggering imperative animations.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other
                  React features without writing a class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were introduced in React 16.8 to enable functional
                  components to have state and side effects, which previously
                  required class components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you
                  already know (state, lifecycle, context, refs, etc.).

                      Context provides a way to pass data through the component

                    <li>
                      It is typically used when some data needs to be accessible

                      In CSR, the initial HTML is minimal, and JavaScript is

                    <li>
                      When a user visits a page, the browser downloads the HTML
                      file, and then JavaScript is executed to fetch data from
                      an API and render the content dynamically.

                    <li>
                      Pros: Fast initial load time, dynamic content updates

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In SSG, pages are pre-built at build time, and the
                      resulting HTML files are served to clients without the
                      need for server-side rendering on each request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      During the build process, the server fetches data,
                      generates HTML pages for each route, and stores them as
                      static files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pros: Blazing-fast load times, reduced server load,
                      improved security, better SEO.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cons: Content may become stale until the next build,
                      dynamic content updates require rebuilding, limited
                      dynamic capabilities.

                    Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) - React + Next.js
                  </h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      ISR is an enhancement of SSG that allows for partial
                      static regeneration of pages on demand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      With ISR, pages are still pre-built at build time, but
                      specific pages can be regenerated in the background or
                      on-demand when new data is available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pros: Combine benefits of SSG with the ability to update
                      specific pages dynamically, improved user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cons: Complexity in managing data revalidation and
                      regeneration, potential for stale data if not configured
                      properly.

              <ul>
                <li>Component names should be in uppercase.</li>
                <li>
                  Attributes in JSX are specified using a camelCase naming
                  convention. For example, class becomes className and onclick
                  becomes onClick.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assign a unique key prop to each element in the list to help
                  React identify which items have changed, are added, or are
                  removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  HTML element should have one parent, use either a div tag or
                  fragment &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;.
                </li>
                <li>All elements must be closed.</li>
                <li>Use the === when comparing values.</li>
                <li>When using CRA, project names need to be in lowercase.</li>
                <li>
                  Either .JSX or .JS file extensions can be used for Functional
                  Components.
                </li>
                <li>One Functional Component per file.</li>
